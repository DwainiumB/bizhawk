Besides the main Bizhawk.sln, there are a number of other projects, each with its own build method.  To develop Bizhawk, you do not need to build these other projects, as they are included prebuild in SVN.  You need only build them if you want to modify the cores themselves.


EMU7800: Load EMU7800/EMU7800.sln; builds as .NET 4.0.  Does file automatically copy to appropriate folder??

genplus-gx: Load genplus-gx/libretro/msvc/msvc-2010.sln; builds as VC++ (VC10).  Output dll automatically copies to appropriate folder.

libgambatte: Process libgambatte/Makefile with mingw.  Use "make install" to copy to output folder.  Alternatively, there is a VC10 solution at libgambatte/libgambatte.sln, but that's not used.

libmeteor: Probably libmeteor/libmeteor.sln, but not well checked.

libmupen64plus: ??

libsnes: During development, run bizwinmake.sh. Edit it as necessary to change profiles and bitness. For making release mode dlls for committing, run bizwinmakedistro.sh. Note that 64bits libsnes doesn't work right now.

quicknes: Process quicknes/mingw/Makefile with mingw.  Use "make install" top copy to output folder.  Alternatively, there is a VC10 solution at quicknes/libquicknes/libquicknes.sln, but that has audio output glitches.

wonderswan: Load wonderswan/bizswan/bizswan.sln; builds as VC++ (VC10).  Output dll automatically copies to appropriate folder.  Alternatively, there is a mingw Makefile at wonderswan/mingw/Makefile, but that's not used.

yabause: Load yabause/src/libyabause/libyabause.sln; builds as VC++ (VC10).  Output dll automatically copies to appropriate folder.


libdarm: stock build from https://github.com/jbremer/darm.git   71a027e0ffb2171d01213c6ecc6da1c49e158398

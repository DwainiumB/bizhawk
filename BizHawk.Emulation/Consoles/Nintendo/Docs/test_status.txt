look for tests here: http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests

blargg's MMC3: 
	FAIL for 4 and 6. i think 4 might not fail until some invisible PPU operations are correct. neither nintendulator or fceux pass these.

blargg's ppu tests: 
	PASS for all but power_up_palette.nes which is lame

blargg's ppu_vbl_nmi:
	FAIL for 9. But hardly anyone passes this.....
	
blargg's sprite hit tests:
	FAIL for 9 and 10. fceux passes 10 (oldppu) and nintendulator passes both. 
	boath are not going to work any time soon due to sprite pattern decoding being separate from BG pattern fetching instead of interleaved.
	
all_instrs.nes
	FAIL (freezes emu??). I think this requires undocumented instructions.
	
cpu_interrupts.nes
	PASS
	
instr_misc.nes
	PASS
	
instr_timing.nes
	PASS
	
nestest.nes
	PASS
	
official_only.nes
	PASS

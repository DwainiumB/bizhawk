* notes on fantasy zone

one theory:
due to having sunsoft-1 chip it was miscategorized against the advice of the elder mapper-making gods as 184 
along with the other sunsoft-1 chips, but this pcb is wired differently, in a way they liked, and so sunsoft-2 
which was released soon thereafter worked the same way

nestopia calls mapper 89 sunsoft-2
nestopia calls mapper 93 sunsoft 2 (a), including fantasy zone

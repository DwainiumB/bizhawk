68000:

Timings:

 - MULU/MULS/DIVU/DIVS have funky timings.
 - How many cycles does TRAP take to execute?
 - How many cycles does it take to accept an interrupt?
 - AND has some funky timings when it comes to immediates?

GAMES:

Ahhh! Real monsters - no sound
Adventures of Mighty Max - crashes memory mapper

Things that read from VRAM work like 50%-90%, but not 100%. It's frustrating. Kid Chameleon and Eternal Champions are examples.

Some games flicker in the rightmost columns. Is this caused by mid-frame mode shifting(32/40 col modes?) Alisia Dragoon is one example.
--- Havent seen an example of this in a long time. Maybe it's a non-issue.



TODO: non-instant DMA emulation
TODO: Add 68000/VDP interrupt enable delay (one instruction, similar to After Burner/PCE)
TODO: H-Ints timing possibly not correct... Some game raster effects work, others don't work as expected. (could be HVC tho)
TODO: Test DMA/ VDP command words.... I'm not at all convinced that VRAM is always correct

TODO: Seems like the Window should be high-priority... or Sprites aren't getting masked or something. Sprites routinely draw over window.




==============
Notable games:
==============

Ghouls n Ghosts sets up the graphics planes backwards from normal, by setting the plane A to be low priority and Plane B to be high priority.
If you have a bug in your priority code this may find it.

Revenge of Shinobi will not play DAC sounds if YM2612 registers are not initialized to L/R channels enabled.

Ballz doesnt really initialize hardly any VDP registers, relies on VDP registers powered-on to the correct values

Contra appears to use VDP A0 set = byte-swap. Not sure if its important in anyway in that game, but the byte swap happens.

Games that use VRAM->VRAM Copy: D&D Warriors of the Eternal Sun, MUSHA, Devilish, Viewpoint

Games that require accurate VRAM fill emulation include Thunder Force IV,
 Contra Hard Corps, Revenge of Shinobi, Taiga Drama, and Sword of Vermillion.

Sonic Spinball reads from VSRAM

68000:

Timings:

 - MULU/MULS/DIVU/DIVS have funky timings.
 - How many cycles does TRAP take to execute?
 - How many cycles does it take to accept an interrupt?
 - AND has some funky timings when it comes to immediates?

 GAMES:

 Monster World 4 - Music is messed up now. Timing is all off. It used to work.
 Quackshot doesn't boot.
 Moonwalker doesn't boot.
 Altered Beast: start with 0 health, 0 lives???
  Contra Hard Corps: Scrolling is messed up in level 1... used to work.
 After Burner 2: No music
 MUSHA: Intro music starts too soon
 MUSHA: uses unimplemented VRAM copy
 MUSHA: Some sprites have messed up left/right symmetry
 Landstalker: freezes during new game sequence, very early
 
 Things that read from VRAM work like 50%-90%, but not 100%. It's frustrating. Kid Chameleon and Eternal Champions are examples.

 Some games flicker in the rightmost columns. Is this caused by mid-frame mode shifting(32/40 col modes?) Alisia Dragoon is one example.


 TODO: non-instant DMA emulation
 TODO: Add 68000/VDP interrupt enable delay (one instruction, similar to After Burner/PCE)
 TODO: freaking H-interrupts
 TODO: Test DMA/ VDP command words.... I'm not at all convinced that VRAM is always correct

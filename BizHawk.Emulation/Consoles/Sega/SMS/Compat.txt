======= Sega MasterSystem Compatibility Issues =======

* CodeMasters games use a custom mapper and special video modes (both implemented)
   + Fantastic Dizzy crashes shortly after starting a new game. Investigating.

* F16 Fighting Falcon uses old SG-1000 video mode.

======= Game Gear compatibility issues =======

* Outrun has raster effect on the wrong line. I've been able to modify interrupt code to
  fix it, but so far, not without breaking other games.
* GG Turrican homebrew not starting correctly

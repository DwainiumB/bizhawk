======= TurboGrafx compatibility issues =======

General: 
 + Noise Channel isn't right. Less obnoxious now, still not happy.
 + T Flag implemented for ADC, EOR. Log warning if used by any other instructions. Should probably just do it for the others, but I hate not having a test case.
 + Video timing is off.
 + Audio volumes are probably wrong.
 + LFO is not implemented, though I can't tell.

Stuff I Fixed That's Not In Other Docs:

+ Street Fighter II special mapper
+ Populous has special BRAM / saveRAM (I have not yet fixed this) - Gunboat appears to be the same
+ After Burner - There is a 1-instruction delay on changes to IRQ Control Byte taking effect
+ There is a one-instruction delay on changes to the I flag taking effect
  - Affects (Not a complete list): Blodia, Body Conquest 2, Champions Forever Boxing,
    Cross Wiber, Jackie Chan, Jigoku Meguri, New Adventure Island, World Beach volley
  - Actually, I'm not at all convinced there's always a 1-instruction delay on the I-flag.
    But this fixes several games; clearly there are delays in some scenarios. But it's not clear
    to me that this delay is ALWAYS present.
+ Writing to the SATB location register of the VDC requests a VRAM->SAT DMA even if the SAT DMA
  bit is disabled in the DCR.

*                   Turbo CD Issues                  *
******************************************************

- Baby Jo, a totally terrible game.
- Download 2, eventually has issues. Seems like waiting on ADPCM interrupts or flags.
- Similar in Dragon Slayer
- Dungeon Explorer II quite desperately need ADPCM audio
  + and a gross corruption issue at teh end of the intro. and then it freezes. :(

- Exile II .. seems to reset itself after playing the unskippable intro. :(
- Macross 2036.. seems impossible to start/play the game. :(

- Rayxanber 2 weird issues at the end of first level with cd audio player
- rtype, end of level 4 dies with unrecognized scsi command ff
- Startling Odyssey does the reset-at-new-game-screen thats rather odd :(
- Super Darius II : at 1st Boss, game freezes waiting for adpcm
- Ys 1, start new game, death by adpcm probably  ** shit it works now.


card angels does poll subcode...


======= TurboGrafx compatibility issues =======

General: 
 + LFO is not implemented, though I can't tell.
 + Screen resolution is an ongoing issue. Some games appear to show garbage beyond what it supposed to be visible.
   Most emulators simply crop the screen at a certain vertical range. For now, I have chosen not to do this.
   Right now the emulator is simply displaying a framebuffer. Eventually, we will do an update that emulates NTSC.
   But for now we're letting this be. There's no intermediate step between emulating a framebuffer and emulating a TV.

Eagan's Rendered Sprite Demo - demonstrates sprites that shouldnt be displayed

===================================
Games that need TV Emulation (to varying degrees)
===================================

Greater degrees:

Final Blaster     - Intro does crazy shit with video modes; not sure what if anything to do about it
Griffon           - Mid-frame res changes (hax to make playable)
Yo, Bro           - Mid-frame res changes (hax to make playable) (IF YOU CAN CALL THIS GAME PLAYABLE)

Lesser degrees:

Aero Blaster      - Bottom of Screen extends too many lines - like 3 extra or so
Alice             - Screen too tall; glitches when scrolling up, but in pcejin also,  
                    but not ootake; ergo probably a timing artifact
Dead Moon         - Screen is too tall
Jack Nicholas Golf- Some screens are too tall and reveal bad gfx below the intended visible screen
Legend of Hero Ton- Slight gfx issue on top of screen
Madoo Granzort    - Screen ~5 pixels too tall
Metal Stoker      - Tearing when scrolling vertically at bottom of screen - screen too tall?
Side Arms         - Screen is like 4 pixels too tall


Game Express card games don't work yet. 

===================================
Stuff I Fixed That's Not In Other Docs:
===================================

+ Street Fighter II special mapper
+ Populous has special SaveRAM, 32k starting at page $40.
+ After Burner - There is a 1-instruction delay on changes to IRQ Control Byte taking effect
+ There is a one-instruction delay on changes to the I flag taking effect
  - Affects (Not a complete list): Blodia, Body Conquest 2, Champions Forever Boxing,
    Cross Wiber, Jackie Chan, Jigoku Meguri, New Adventure Island, World Beach volley
  - Actually, I'm not at all convinced there's always a 1-instruction delay on the I-flag.
    But this fixes several games; clearly there are delays in some scenarios. But it's not clear
    to me that this delay is ALWAYS present.
+ Writing to the SATB location register of the VDC requests a VRAM->SAT DMA even if the SAT DMA
  bit is disabled in the DCR.
+ This is in other docs, but Fighting Run requires full MWR register emulation including the various
  4 color modes. It appears to be the only game that requires this, and it's a shitty game. :(
+ The ROM of Paranoia (J) that is commonly labeled as the authoritative dump - I assume its a bad
  dump, because it dies during the 3rd stage on ALL EMULATORS. Alternative versions of the rom 
  work fine.
+ Puzzle Boy - requests frame height of 512... cap active display to 242 lines

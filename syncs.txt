Bonk's Adventure (1631M) desyncs on level 1-2 at ~3000 frames.
Dungeon Explorer (1645M) does nothing more than get past the title screen.
Madoo Granzort (1432M) desyncs after hitting the first boss a few times at ~3500 frames.
Shockman (1690M) desyncs at ~20000 frames.
Ninja Spirit (1447M) desyncs right before the first boss battle at around ~5000 frames. The actual desync may have occured earlier, however, as the desync is caused by the player getting killed by an enemy that followed him for a while. This enemy probably should have been killed.
When I had near given up all hope, Viglante (1677M) ran through the entire movie file. It seems to sync just as well at 200%.

As the .mcm files cannot be read by Bizhawk, that is my report on how the PCE TASes sync. 1/6 of them sync.

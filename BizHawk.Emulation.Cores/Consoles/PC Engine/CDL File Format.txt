====Type definitions==============

A "string" is an LEB128 encoded number which is the number of bytes
in the string, followed by that many bytes of UTF-8 character data.

A "number" is a little endian 32 bit integer.



====File format is as follows:====

string id: file identifier, always "BIZHAWK-CDL-1"
number NumberOfBlocks: number of memory areas represented in this file

For each block:

string BlockName: identifying name of the block.
number bytelength: length of the block in bytes.
byte data[bytelength]: one byte of information for each byte in the original block.


====Other definitions:============

The BlockNames are:

ROM
  HUCard ROM, or syscard bios ROm

Cart Battery RAM
  32K of battery backed ram in the Populous cart

Super System Card RAM
  192K of ram in the super system card

TurboCD RAM
  64K of ram in the turboCD

BRAM
  8K of TurboCD backup RAM.  The actual RAM is smaller, but the CDL will record all
  activity in that 8K region.

Main Memory
  8K or 32K (SGX) of main memory

MMIO
  8K of space in block ff, containing system IO ports.

UNKNOWN
  8K long area which any unknown block maps to.


Each byte has 8 bits of flags on what the byte has been observed to do:

// was fetched as an opcode
Code = 0x01,
// was read or written as data
Data = 0x02,
// was read and used as a pointer to data via indirect addressing
DataPtr = 0x04,
// was read or written as stack
Stack = 0x08,
// was read or written as data via indirect addressing
IndirectData = 0x10,
// was read and used as function pointer
// NB: there is no "IndirectCode"; all code is marked simply as code regardless of how it is reached
FcnPtr = 0x20,
// was used as a source (either initial or during the loop) of a block xfer
BlockFrom = 0x40,
// was used as a destination (either initial or during the loop) of a block xfer
BlockTo = 0x80

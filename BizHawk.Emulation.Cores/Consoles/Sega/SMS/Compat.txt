======= SMS compatibility issues =======

* Several korean TMS games don't work. Possibly mapper issue?
* Janggun-ui Adeul (Korea).sms - Sprite flip gfx issue? Could be interesting to investigate. Cogwheel does the same; Kega wont even boot the game
* Jang Pung 3 - boots but totally fuxed?
* Pretty much everything with (korea) in it needs to be checked. Stupid rare korea shit.

* NBA-Jam SMS Proto: works in PAL mode, which is how it's designed to run.
  In NTSC mode, it is impossible to start a game, however, it is possible on
  other emulators.
  Need to give it a test on Everdrive, and eventually investigate its NTSC behavior,
  but don't really consider it super-high priority since it works correctly in PAL mode.

* Desert Strike - you can enter the map screen but cannot leave.

Could probably stand to do another pass on SMS emulation after Genesis is working.

======= Game Gear compatibility issues =======

* Outrun has raster effect on the wrong line. I've been able to modify interrupt code to
  fix it, but so far, not without breaking other games.

======= SG-1000 compatibility checklist =======

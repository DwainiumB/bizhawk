======= SMS compatibility issues =======

Hopefully due to sprite collision thingy?

Korean games currently not booting:
 - FA Tetris
 - Flashpoint
 - Sky Jaguar boots but gfx issues (works in cogwheel) (but not in MEKA!)

* NBA-Jam SMS Proto: works in PAL mode, which is how it's designed to run.
  In NTSC mode, it is impossible to start a game, however, it is possible on
  other emulators.
  Need to give it a test on Everdrive, and eventually investigate its NTSC behavior,
  but don't really consider it super-high priority since it works correctly in PAL mode.

* Desert Strike - you can enter the map screen but cannot leave.

- Light Gun emulation
- Paddle emulation
- Sports pad emulation?

Could probably stand to do another pass on SMS emulation after Genesis is working.

======= Game Gear compatibility issues =======

* Ernie Els Golf has weird gfx corruption. Also in Cogwheel and Kega. Works in MEKA and Regen
* Outrun has raster effect on the wrong line. I've been able to modify interrupt code to
  fix it, but so far, not without breaking other games.

======= SG-1000 compatibility checklist =======

	// Generates SEMI-synchronous sound, or "buffered asynchronous" sound.

	// This class will try as hard as it can to request the correct number of samples on each frame and then 
	// send them out to the sound card as it needs them.

	// However, it has minimum/maximum buffer targets and will request smaller or larger frames if it has to.
	// The ultimate goal of this strategy is to make MOST frames 100% correct, and if errors must occur, 
	// concentrate it on a single frame, rather than distribute small errors across most frames, as
	// distributing error to most frames tends to result in persistently distorted audio, especially when
	// sample playback is involved.


	/*
	 * Why use this, when each core has it's own Async sound output?
	 * 
	 * It is true that each emulation core provides its own async sound output, either through directly
	 * rendering to arbitrary buffers (pce not turbocd, sms), or using one of the metaspus (nes, turbocd).
	 * 
	 * Unfortunately, the vecna metaspu is not perfect, and for maintaining near-realtime playback (the usual
	 * situation which we want to optimize for), it simply sounds better with a BufferedAsync on top of it.
	 * 
	 * TODO: BufferedAsync has some hard coded parameters that assume FPS = 60.  make that more generalized.
	 * TODO: For systems that _really_ don't need BufferedAsync (pce not turbocd, sms), make a way to signal
	 *       that and then bypass the BufferedAsync.

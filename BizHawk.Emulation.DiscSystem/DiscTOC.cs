	/// The TOC contains information directly describing the structure of the disc, as well as some more logically structured information derived from that.
	/// Additionally, this class contains methods to synchronize between them. 
	/// This is a bit weird.. Perhaps the different views of the data should be seaprated.
	/// 
	/// One final caveat - I think the TOC should be independent for independent sessions.. the concept of multi-sessioning is so thoroughly ill-supported here, it will require radical renovation ever to support.
	/// 
	/// Sessions -> Tracks : These are the highest-level data structures of the disc. We should probably rename this to something like DiscStructure, and save DiscTOC for the actual TOC.
	/// TOCPoint : These are the basic logical unit of data stored in the TOC. They're basically bookmarks for tracks.
	/// TOCEntry : These are the basic unit of data in the rawest view of the TOC. They're stored in the lead-in Q subchannel, and there are multiple redundant copies, and they store several different types of information.
